# TGP - Transposition Given a Position (in numbers)
  This code was intended to explain cryptography to a coworker using  pseudokey to encrypt a message, this is achieved
  giving the program a series of non repeated numbers from 1 to 5 eg: "13425" that Scramble the word input into those
  positions, no further validations were added since were only meant to proof the concept.
  
  you are more than welcome to modify the code to add further validation to the code.

  Jaime Lopez is just an average guy trying to learn the ways of python by his own and _might not_ be able
  to help you if you have any deep question about life or coding in general, BUT, will gladly hear you and share
  some awesome taco recipes.
  
  Enjoy my work.
